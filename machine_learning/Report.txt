Instructions to Run
--------------------
1. First run prepare_data to create the train, val and test data.
2. Then run train.py to generate train the model and save the model weights file.
3. Then run test.py to evaluate the model.

Preprocess
----------
- Each input is padded with zeros to mimic 15 objects.
- Entries from each input .txt file is divided into train, val and test data
- 75 columns are shortened to 15 columns by combining positional information insto a list for each object.

Model Details
--------------
Input -> LSTM Layer -> Fully Connected Layer -> Output

- Input is organized as (batch_size, num_objects=15, FeatureDimension=5).
- Ouput is organized is same way

Results
-------
Test Loss: 0.124
